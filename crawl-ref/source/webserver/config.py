# ### Server Operators ###
# If you want to customise any settings in this file, you'll need to work around
# the fact that is version controlled. Some options:
# 1. Use a local commit and always do a rebase pull on top of it. (This may
#    affect versioning, though.)
# 2. Create config.yml and write your overrides in there.
# 3. Use a more complicated scripting system; for example, dgamelaunch-config
#    supports templating this file and automatically handles merging the
#    server config with the repository files.
#
# ### Developers ###
# Warning! Servers will not update or merge with the version controlled copy of
# this file, so any parameters here should be presented as recommendations or
# documentation of the default, not a default value, and option name changes
# here will require manual intervention on the part of server admins. New
# values should always come with a default that does not lead to crashes, so
# that something sensible happens on DGL upgrade.
#
# To add new default values, see the `webtiles.config` module. Note that
# webtiles.config.get(x) returns `None` if `x` is not present in the config
# data, so this can be taken as a default default value.
#
# Bad assumptions about config defaults particularly impacts templated html
# files, which are loaded and called dynamically, so *do* get updated
# immediately on a rebuild (unlike python code in this module or
# webtiles.config). If something like client.html raises an exception, this
# will trigger 500 errors across the whole server.

# Game configs
# You can define game configs in two ways:
# 1. As *.yml files in `games.d/`. (default; see games.d/base.yml)
# 2. With a dictionary `games` in this file (not recommended except for dgamelaunch-config servers).

# to override 1, simply set `games` in this file to something non-empty; see
# the below example. To force using both, set `use_game_yaml` to True. Games
# defined in this file will precede games defined in games.d.
# use_game_yaml = True

# Templating:
# if the `version` key is set, most game parameters will support templating
# with %v, %V, and %r.
#   %v: the version value as-is
#   %V: the capitalized version value (e.g. "trunk" -> "Trunk")
#   %r: the 'raw' version, which strips off an initial "0.". So for example,
#       "0.29" would give just "29". If this substring does not occur, %r
#       is equivalent to %v. (Implementation note: characters before a "0."
#       will be dropped as well. Not relevant for normal crawl versions of
#       course.)
#
# Most fields (though not all, in particular, not any game-general ones and
# not socket_path) also support templating with %n, which gives the player's
# username.
#
# The example below illustrates basic uses of both of these.

# Example of defining `games` directly via a dictionary.
# This setting to be an OrderedDict pre python 3.6, so this example uses that
# for compatibility:

# import collections
# games = collections.OrderedDict([

# Username management options.
#
# This options are used on a running webserver only for new account creation!
# It is possible to run a ban query against an existing userdb with them as
# well, see wtutil.py options --check-config-bans and --run-config-bans. For
# banning offensive names, skip to `banned` below. Crawl nicknames are case
# preserving but not case sensitive. To be an acceptable username, a string
# must pass all three of these checks (if defined).
#
# 1. Use `nick_regex` to modify the basic format for valid nicknames.
# a nick is allowed if it matches this regex. It is not recommended to modify
# this unless you really know what you're doing, and this default should not
# ever be modified to something less restrictive for official servers.
# nick_regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,20}$"
#
# 2. `nick_check_fun` if defined, is a function that returns true on valid
# nicknames. You can use this for arbitrary custom nick checks in a server
# config. You will need to do case management manually in this funciton.
# def nick_check_fun(s):
#     return s.lower() != "plog" and s.lower() != "muggle"
#
# 3. For easily excluding a larger list of usernames from account creation, you
# can use the `banned` option. This can take a simple list of names, or some
# more complex things. Instead of or in addition to putting banned names in
# config, you can put them in files named `banned_players.txt` and
# `banned_players.yml`. The latter must have a single dict entry `banned`
# that is allowed to use the complex options below.
#
# Simple example:
# banned = ['plog', 'muggle', 'muggles', 'ihatemuggles']
#
# Complex example. This will ban many things, for example,
# plain 'muggle', leetspeak variants like 'mugg13s', versions of the phrase
# embedded into other contexts with different letter repeats such as
# 'xx1hatemugggglesxx', etc. It is recommended to be fairly cautious when using
# these extended options, because of
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem; there are very few English
# slurs where it is a good idea to turn on all three of these options.
# You can mix plain strings with complex entries, as shown here:
#
# banned = ['plog',
#           {'options': {'leet': True, 'repeats': True, 'part': True},
#            'names': ['muggle']}]
# it is allowed to mix in plain strings with dicts in this list,

# Example to demonstrate this same list in yml form:
# banned:
#   - plog
#   - options:
#       leet: True
#       repeats: True
#       part: True
#     names:
#       - muggle
#
# It is recommended to use an external file rather than defining this option
# directly in config. (Among other reasons, this means that server admins are
# only viewing/editing a file likely filled with slurs when they are actually
# intending to...)
